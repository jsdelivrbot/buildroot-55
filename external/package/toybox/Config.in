	  Toybox combines common Linux command line utilities together into
	  a single executable that's simple, small, fast, and reasonably
	  standards compliant.

	  It was started by an ex-maintainer of BusyBox, and uses the same
	  "multicall binary configured at build time via menuconfig" approach,
	  but is a fresh implementation that uses no busybox code.

	  Toybox is licensed under a "zero clause" BSD variant which grants
	  the same blanket permissions but removes the requirement to copy
	  specific license text into derivative works, essentially placing
	  its code into the public domain.

config BR2_PACKAGE_TOYBOX_CONFIG
	string "Toybox configuration file:"
	default "package/toybox/toybox.config"
	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_TOYBOX
	help
	  Specify an alternative config file location enabling a different
	  set of commands in toybox. The default file equals "make defconfig".
